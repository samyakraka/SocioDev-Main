Her dreams of becoming a teacher faded each day.\r\n\r\nOne morning, volunteers from an NGO called Light for Learning visited her village. They were running a campaign to bring children back to school. Meera watched curiously as they played, read stories, and handed out books.\r\n\r\nA volunteer named Ananya noticed Meera's bright eyes and asked, \u201cDo you like stories?\u201d Meera nodded shyly. The next day, Ananya came back\u2014with a storybook and a promise: \u201cCome to our learning center. Just one hour a day.\u201d\r\n\r\nCuriosity turned into habit. Habit became hope.\r\n\r\nWithin months, Meera was back in school\u2014with new uniforms, books, and her favorite purple backpack, all provided by the NGO. Today, she helps her younger brother read, and tells everyone she\u2019ll grow up to be a teacher.\r\n\r\nAnd she always says, with a smile, \u201cIt all started with one story.\u201d\r\n",
